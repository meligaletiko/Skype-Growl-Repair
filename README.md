==================

Do you use Skype and loves the Growl notification system?!
With the Mac OS X Lion and newer, restore windows system, skype uses built-in notification system instead of growl. When it happens i create a shell script that runs when user login.
Now has i see some users with the same problem i have create an app with applescript to fix the problem.
